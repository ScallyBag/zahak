# The name

Zahak (or Zahhak or Azhi Dahak) is an evil figure in Iranian/Kurdish/Perisan
mythology, evident in ancient Iranian folklore as Azhi DahƒÅka, the name by
which he also appears in the texts of the Avesta.  Legend has that, that he two
giant snakes on his shoulders that he had to feed them two human brains on
daily basis, you can read more about him

# Play Zahak online

Zahak is new to LiChess, you can play him and be impressed with him. His LiChess handle is [zahak_engine](https://lichess.org/@/zahak_engine). He is currently running on an old RaspberryPi device, so do not expect a truly amazing performance. But, hopefully he will be online 24/7.

Other features exist, for example you can run `perft` with `./zahak -perft` or profile it with `./zahak -profile`.
You can also run it in perfttree mode with `./zahak -preft-tree`.
